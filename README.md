# Game Title to be determined

# Purpose
This is a simple game written in **Lua** using the **Love2D** game framework.
It plays like most other twin stick shooters, where the direction the player is firing is independent from the direction the player is moving.
This game was designed to be very simple because it will serve as a platform for me to experiment with different machine learning algorithms such as
	* N.E.A.T (Neural Evolution of Augmenting Topoligies)
	* Q-Learning

# Progress on the project
The following are a simple checklist of things yet to be done on the project:
* \[ \] Implement player movement
* \[ \] Implement enemies
* \[ \] Implement health and losing
* \[ \] Implement systems to be used by neural network (sightline vision, etc.)
* \[ \] Implement some kind of neural network
* \[ \] Write more tasks to do (this will never be checked)

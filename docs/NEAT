------------ Document to help me understand how NEAT works --------------

The word neuron and node can be used interchangibly here.

A genome describes a phenotype (in our case a neural network)
A gene in the genome correspondes to a weight in the neural network
The genome starts as simply the input nodes and the output nodes
	- New nodes are added through mutation

Mutation can be:
	- Changing the genes (changing the weights)
	- Adding a gene (adding a connection)
	- Splitting a gene into two, creating a new node in the process
	


The basic process is:
	1. Create an empty list of species (list of genomes)
	1.5 Populate the list with the number of species
	2. Mutate each member of the of the species a little bit
	3. Run the trials
	4. Remove the lowest performing members, say bottom 50%
	6. Use breeding to combine the remaining members of the species into more members
		(each step of this is called a generation)
	7. Go to step 2

So I guess I'm not using speciation....
	That's okay for now







In case I need it

The compatibility formula is
	delta = c1 * E / N + c2 * D / N + c3 * W

	c1, c2, c3 are coefficients used to adjust the importance of the factors
	N is number of genes in the larger genome
	E is the number of excess genes
	D is the number of disjoint genes

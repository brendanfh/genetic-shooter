Things to fix tonight...

* Need to be able to save and load the generations

\, main.lua has a lot of logic that can be split up
	\, Should have a "Tester" class that encapsulates the updating and handling population growth
	- Should have a Statistics class that calculates basic stats on a list of numbers

- Way to "manually" play the game

- Need to be able to train the AI without running the visuals
	- Separate logic
